# Visual Servoing for Pose Control of Soft Continuum Arm in a Structured Environment

This repository contains the official code for the paper "Visual Servoing for Pose Control of Soft Continuum Arm in a Structured Environment", accepted for publication at RA-L + RoboSoft 2022.

## Usage

The repository consists of 2 folders:
  1. Model - This folder contains the TensorFlow implementation for predicting the absolute actuation values of the soft arm given image input.
  2. Utils - This folder contains python code for finding out the positional and rotational error between the predicted and true actuations and plotting the histograms. 
  
## Dataset

You can run this code on custom image datasets along with custom lables by giving the appropriate path to the dataset.
