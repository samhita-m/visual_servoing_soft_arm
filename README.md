# visual_servoing_soft_arm

This repository contains the official code for the paper "Visual Servoing for Pose Control of Soft Continuum Arm in a Structured Environment", accepted for publication at RA-L + RoboSoft 2022.

The repository consists of 2 folders:
  1. Model - This folder contains code for predicting the absolute actuation values of the soft arm given image input.
  2. Utils - This folder contains code for plotting the histogram and finding out the positional and rotational error between the predicted and true actuations.
